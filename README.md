# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Lab Environment Setup

### üéØ Objective
In this part of the project, I‚Äôm setting up a small virtual lab with three virtual machines. The goal is to ensure they can communicate with each other and serve as the foundation for future cybersecurity and SIEM-related configurations.

### üß± Virtual Machines

1. **Windows Server 1** ‚Äì **Domain Controller (DC)**
   - Promoted to a Domain Controller.
   - Configured with **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.
   - Will manage domain authentication and Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

2. **Windows Server 2** ‚Äì **Domain-Joined Client**
   - Joined to the domain controlled by Windows Server 1.
   - Used for testing domain communication and policy enforcement.

3. **Ubuntu Server** ‚Äì **Splunk Server**
   - Serves as the central logging system using **Splunk**.
   - Will collect logs from the Windows machines for future security analysis.
### üîë Step 1: Create a Vultr Account

To begin setting up the cloud environment, head over to [**Vultr**](https://www.vultr.com/) and create an account.

> üìù **Note:** You will need a **valid credit card** to verify your identity and activate your account.

Once your account is set up, you‚Äôll have access to the Vultr dashboard where you can deploy virtual machines (instances) in just a few clicks.

### üí≥ Step 2: Add Billing Information & Claim Free Credit

After creating your Vultr account, go to the **Billing** section in your dashboard.

1. Add a **valid credit card** to verify your account.
2. If you're a **new user**, you may be eligible to receive **up to $300 in free credit** as part of Vultr's promotional offer.
3. At the bottom make sure you click on deposit $0.00 and link my credit card. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The free credit promotion is available for **new users only** and may vary based on current offers. Be sure to check the Vultr homepage or your email for any applicable promo codes.

Step 3: once you have enter your credit card information, on the left side of your dashboard, click on product s then computer then in the middle of the window click xccomuter then "Deploy Server" 

# Deploying Servers

These next step-by-step guides will show you how to install and configure a server from scratch.

I‚Äôll walk you through the full setup process for the **first server**. Once that‚Äôs done, you can follow the **same steps** to deploy the **second server**, which will serve as our **test machine** (a Windows Server).

1. **Navigate to https://my.vultr.com/** Sign in with your credentials
2. **Click "Products"**

## For the 2nd Server

Follow the **exact same steps** from **Step One**, but make the following change when selecting server specifications:

### Specs for the Test Server:
- **Plan:** `vc2-1c-2gb`
- **Price:** $10/month

> üìù This configuration is lighter and more cost-effective. It‚Äôs ideal for a test machine since we don‚Äôt need high performance for this environment.

## Deploying Ubuntu server

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This option is lighter than the primary server because we don‚Äôt need high performance ‚Äî it's strictly for testing purposes.

Keep following the same process unless otherwise noted, and you'll have both servers deployed successfully.
